# 2025 Fires and Emission Levels in Spain

Background: This dataset is a synthesized master file from the Global Wildfire Information System (GWIS), a joint initiative of the European Commission and the European Space Agency. It combines three critical streams of satellite-derived data for Spain: the number of active fires, the total burnt area, and the resulting atmospheric emissions.

The Data Structure:To make the analysis intuitive, all columns (except for Day) have been prefixed to identify their data source:
- `nf_` (Number of Fires): Counts of individual thermal anomalies.
- `ba_` (Burnt Area): Total surface area affected, measured in hectares 
- `em_` (Emissions): Estimated carbon and trace gas release.
